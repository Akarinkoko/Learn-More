            <h2>What is Environmental Science?</h2>
            <p>Environmental science studies the interactions between the physical, chemical, and biological components of the earth's systems, focusing on issues like pollution, biodiversity, and sustainability. Through interdisciplinary approaches, scientists aim to understand human impact on ecosystems and find sustainable solutions.</p>

            <h2>Goals of Environmental Science</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Promote Sustainability:</strong> Ensure that natural resources are conserved and used responsibly to support future generations.</li>
                <li><strong>Protect Biodiversity:</strong> Safeguard diverse species and ecosystems essential for ecological balance.</li>
                <li><strong>Combat Climate Change:</strong> Address the causes of climate change and reduce its impact through mitigation and adaptation.</li>
                <li><strong>Improve Human Health:</strong> Minimize environmental hazards that can harm human health, such as pollution and toxic waste.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Challenges in Environmental Science</h2>
            <div class="challenge-card">
                <h3>Deforestation</h3>
                <p>Deforestation leads to loss of biodiversity, disrupts water cycles, and contributes to climate change. Efforts to curb deforestation focus on sustainable land management and reforestation programs.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="challenge-card">
                <h3>Plastic Pollution</h3>
                <p>Plastic waste harms marine life, clogs waterways, and enters food chains. Reducing plastic use and improving waste management are critical steps to addressing this issue.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="challenge-card">
                <h3>Water Scarcity</h3>
                <p>Access to clean water is a growing concern as populations increase and climate change alters water availability. Solutions include water conservation, improved infrastructure, and sustainable practices.</p>
            </div>
